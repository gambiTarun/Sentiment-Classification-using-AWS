__label__1 "i ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you 're well endowed . it 's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs . have n't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized ( but cozy ) and it 's really long . it almost touches the top of my knees in back . sooooo pretty though ."

__label__0 "i love this fabric and the design details of this top . but i am only 5 ' 3 and this top ends above my waist ! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering . i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is . tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out for someone without a perfectly flat tummy ."

__label__0 "i did n't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i 'm not really liking it . it 's the rough unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well rough around the edges . it 's a nicely cut great fitting sweater though so i 'll be looking for some scarves !"

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the grey that you order is much much lighter grey . in addition this shirt is super boxy ... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in . going back disappointed ."

__label__0 "cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs . sizing is ridiculous . and now that i have an xs that is too big the xxs are sold out . typical ."
__label__0 "as with most retailer tops this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle . i ordered an xs . it 's a very nice pretty sweater that i 'm going to try in an xxs . the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath . the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale . the white is a soft winter white ."
__label__-1 "i loved these pants the minute i put them on and was so happy i 'd ordered them . but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open ! i think the faux leather just is n't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings . i was super-bummed about this because these pants are so insanely cute . but if they ca n't hold up to a few casual wears then there 's just no way ... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom"
__label__1 "wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn . the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad . bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater !"
__label__-1 "i agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture . much shorter than that . and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price ..."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this because it 's all my favorites : simple chic design ; pure silk ; gorgeous color . in reality the dress was 100 % see-through very thin and poor quality silk . i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses . despite the thin quality of the silk i was still considering spending this dress ( despite it 's unreasonably high $ $ $ for the quality ) but after trying it on i was really disappoin"
__label__-1 "when i saw this jacket in store i fell in love with it . the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous . i am 5 ' 3 130 # 36dd with petite frame . i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide . the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly . the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality . i ordered a petite m and it was no better . i literally looked like a big marshmallow ... a linebacker ! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc"
__label__-1 "the design is gorgeous the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable . however it 's extremely see thru ."
__label__-1 "i have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color . these are less flattering and i may not keep them ."
__label__1 "i bought this in both the black motif and the ivory . i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size . the fabric is very comfortable and does n't wrinkle easily . it does have a flowy look to it but i did n't find that it had too much fabric . i would n't tuck it in though . i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days . the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique . i recommend the shirt ."
__label__1 "i liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store . it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me . still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift . once i tried it on i really liked the way it looked and felt ! it 's flattering comfortable and looks great with jeans ! it 's really cozy ! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it ."
__label__1 "i purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking . though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust . and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy . for a looser fit you may want to size up . for a more fitted look it is true to size ."
__label__0 "i desperately wanted this to work - it 's a beautiful color and overall quality ... it is just so short and wide ( almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat ) . i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side but on my 5 ' 7 frame and long torso it just did n't look right . few extra inches and this could have been awesome !"
__label__1 "for once i found a peasant top that was n't a balloon . i 'm 5 ' 1 and curvier on top and the small fit great . the blouse billowed a bit but it did n't make me look like a hot air balloon . the pattern of the blouse a mix of various floral swatches is very pretty . the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall . i ca n't wait to wear it !"
__label__0 "fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they did n't have it in my size ( 0 ) -- thought i 'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well . alas the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped . a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body but on my slight frame it was not flattering . it 's going back to retailer ."
__label__1 "this dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i 'm attending . september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect . the shimmer ( which is n't apparent from the website ) makes it festive enough for a wedding ."
__label__1 "i love this vest . get compliments every time i wear it . it 's stretchy too : ) . unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there . so little tip do n't spill on it lol . my fault though so still 5 stars !"
__label__0 "i actually love this dress . the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing . the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look . my issue is the way it looks on my body -- not flattering . i already have a squarish apple ( squarple ? ! ) body and the cut emphasizes this more . i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does so i sized up . all this did was make me look wider especially at the shoulders . the drawstring at the elastic makes"
__label__-1 "great color but frumpy fit . if you have any bust it looks a bit like maternity"
__label__0 "i bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look . i 'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it . it runs small . i plan on wearing it for casual errand days ."
__label__1 "i bought this in my usual medium and it fits great ( fitted at the shoulder loose below ) . it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories ."
__label__0 "these leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants ; the rise is perfect . the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger ."
__label__0 "i like the fabric and aesthetic of this top and really wanted to like it however i wish it were longer . i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes but even the medium felt short and clingy . however that might be because i 'm curvy with a long torso so i 'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online !"
__label__1 "this color is gorgeous . this could be dressed up or down . great buy !"
__label__-1 "regretfully this dress is on its way back for an exchange . the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size i ordered it in both colors however the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom . again the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching pulls or tears for an exchange but i ca n't pay 130 for a dress that is already torn ."
__label__1 "i ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower . the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long . so glad i made this purchase ."
__label__0 "runs large and pocket detail is very prominent . wanted a crisper trouser-like pant -- this is not it !"
__label__-1 "ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping . not well designed . i do n't recommend this tee at all ."
__label__1 "but tight around the chest i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else . green color is classic and the back is longer than the front . overall flattering if with the right outfit . i 'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference ."
__label__0 "i snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring . it is very delicate and i ca n't wear it when i 'm with my kids because they pull on it so much ! it will just me by night out wrap i guess ! ! !"
__label__1 "i felt compelled to write a review to tell everyone to size up . i am 5 ' 4 130 lbs 34d and normally wear a size 4 ( give or take ) . i debated between the 6 & 8 after reading the reviews and went with the 8 and so glad i did ! if you 're in doubt between sizes even after sizing up go up one more especially if you 're bigger up top . mine fit * okay * in them but probably could have even done better with a larger cup . what 's weird is that they sew in liner cups so you ca n't remove them without cutting"
__label__-1 "this blouse is quite stiff . i would n't mind the boxiness if this blouse were n't so long . even if you size down because of the eyelet and the cute hem it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit ."
__label__0 "the fabric is very thin . it is n't see through just thin . i would have kept this if the full length shell was n't longer than the dress ."
__label__1 "although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me ! love the material style just does n't look right on me !"
__label__0 "i ordered this in blue and loved the color . i 'm not typically into the flowing top style but i tried a few items on my last order this being one . it 's unseamed at the bottom which was my primary reason for returning it - i could n't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style this item is good quality soft comfortable material and a great spring or fall blue ."
__label__1 "cute staple in classic style overall . fabric weight is good will be able to get by with nude bra . many wardrobe options with this staple ."
__label__0 "... maybe i would 've kept this top . i love the print colors and design . however i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it . since my bust and torso seemed too large for it the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good ."
__label__0 "this dress is nice colors and well made but it 's just not the style for me . it almost fits frumpy . i 'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good . also being 5 ' 8 it is shorter than i 'd wear . i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful blouse . very pretty and looks well made . unfortunately i had to send it back . i 'm looking for a more classic cut . it has an a line/tent shape . when i put it on and put my arms above my head the bottom of the blouse was up to my bra ! i would order from this brand again ."
__label__1 "this garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it . i am probably between a small and xsmall but ordered the xsmall . it is snug but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath just in case the buttons gap just a little . i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping . it is also a little snug in the elbow area ."
__label__-1 "this one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way . did not like the way that it fit . returned"
__label__1 "love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days . i love the squishy soft feel of the material . it works well with sweaters . love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet . i love how simple and practical this coat is . the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head ."

__label__-1 "the design and quality were great . i really wanted them to fit but they ran large . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small . unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i wo n't be trying a size down . the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward . sadly these went back ."
__label__0 "this is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady . i miss not having to consider those things . the red color is lovely and the dress is modest . i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita ."
__label__0 "so small ! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight . i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to . the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny . this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips . returning ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress . the cut fit and color are adorable . unfortunately the fabric is super thin . due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s . i was on the fence of keeping it but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it . i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue . i am most likely going to return it ; even at 15 % off it is over-priced for the cheap"
__label__-1 "every single time i was in a store this dress caught my eye . there was never a large or xl to try on ; however so when a free shipping offer came up i took a chance and ordered both . the xl was too large ; the large was much better but a little snug so if it shrunk i would have been out of luck . if i would have kept one it would have been the large ; however they are both going back . a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger but on a body it is"

__label__0 "i first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater : the stitch is pretty but the fabric is n't nearly as soft as i expected . it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater . that said the fit is pretty flattering . i did n't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model . i 've been looking for this style of sweater so i 'll probably keep it . however it really did n't meet my expectations for quality ."
__label__-1 "i was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person . it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles . pass !"
__label__-1 "i wanted so much to love this dress but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it . the color of the dress ( green ) was lovely and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much . i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large ; but even at that size the dress was too large especially around the hips ( which for someone with an hourglass figure is saying a lot ! ) . the extra fabric around the hips belled out some making"
__label__0 "this is a darling little sweater . it is well made and the fit is true to size however it 's just not long enough on me to be a top which is what i was hoping for . i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40 's style but it 's way to short on me for that . even with my highest waisted pants and skirts it shows skin . i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something . that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos . i 'm still"

__label__-1 "i loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress . it 's loose and flows but does n't look like a potato sack . i wore it once and got a ton of compliments . that said i hand washed it as the tag states then let it line dry and it shrunk to half its size ! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states dry clean recommended . boo . so disappointed that i spend over $ 100 for a dress i wore once ."

__label__1 "wearing this today ! it fits true is size & is machine washable . the slits make it unique . do n't hesitate to purchase this one ."
__label__1 "i just bought this and really think it is a great dress ! it is conservative and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church . i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes yet i do not like to look frumpy . this is cute and chic yet conservative . also j got 25 % because it is black friday . thank you retailer ! ! !"
__label__1 "i am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit . however the petite looks great and the length is perfect . it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings . i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose . i am 5 ' 3 and 125lbs . this will be my go to for fall ! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater !"
__label__1 "i run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts . i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did . the fit is lovely and flattering . i loved this shirt the second i put it on -- then went to order it in another color ."
__label__-1 "i loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy . i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better . it made me look very wide . loved it online but it was n't for me returned it ."
__label__0 "this shirt is not awful but not anything pretty . there 's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist ! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in . so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways . it 's one of those i 'm too lazy to send it back it 's not that awful"
__label__-1 "no . this is one of the most unflattering things i 've ever put on my body . i 'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge . do n't do it ."
__label__-1 "i loved the look of this top online - it had great lines . i was so disappointed when i received it . it has zero support/lining and i 'm not large chested to need a lot . it 's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it making it even harder to get off . it was returned ."
__label__0 "this is a cute shirt but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular flap . it 's not visible from the photo . i think it 'll have to be returned for this reason ."
__label__0 "like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small ) . fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits . unflattering how the slits hit me . maybe for some one taller ( i am 5 ' 3 ) ."
__label__0 "i really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy . i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same boxy but shorter so i decided to pass ."
__label__-1 "this dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it . i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available . the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed . however the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky . i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering ."
__label__0 "i love the way the mock neck style looks but the shirt is cut very small . i realize it 's supposed to stretch but it 's still very very tight on particularly in the shoulder area . if you like the style i 'd recommend sizing up ."
__label__1 "this cardigan did not disappoint . i purchased the orange which is a beautiful deep red orange that is perfect for fall . the fit is true to size and the length of the cardigan is nice hitting at mid hip . the ruffles hang well and are not too bulky or overwhelming on my petite frame . it looks great from the side as well . i love the knitted details the scallops and the subtle gathers . the only flaw is that the sleeves are way too long to be practical . they come to my fingertips so get in the w"
__label__0 "overall the dress is beautiful easy and great quality . but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo if that makes sense . it 's not poofy or super-layered but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here . besides that bottom part the fit is true to size . but as a petit the extra fabric is n't what i 'm looking for . i think it works depending on what you 're looking for . beautiful though !"
__label__1 "these are great wear- anywhere shorts . they are not too long and not too short . they are very soft and comfy . i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps . i will still keep the 6 's for wearing around the house ."
__label__0 "really wanted this to worked for me . ordered the s in ivory ( the color i really wanted but xs was sold out ) and the xs in cedar . loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs . not flattering on my petite frame ( 5 ' 2 115 # ) . so disappointed as i 've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this ."

__label__1 "so i love this top . i got it in black and red . both are amazing and go with about anything . they run a bit large . i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck . i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry . i would say it shrunk 10 % at most . beyond that no difference . in fact it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big . obviously if you do not dry clean this you are going against manufacturer recommendations but i"

__label__0 "i ordered the pink and it was gorgeous . the color and feel were so soft i would have kept it if it were a blanket . but i did send it back because as a sweater it just did n't lay right . it has a sort of inside layer that just did n't fit right with the outside sweater layer so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist . that was not flattering . and the hood was too large and floppy looking . too bad ."
__label__-1 "the length of this dress is bizarre . i ca n't decide if it 's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i 'm not sure if i like it either way . also- at this price point i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent . if you buy this dress be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people can not see your underwear . the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur"

__label__-1 "dress is nice but ca n't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself . it is around 30 in length so is more of a tunic than a dress . i 'm only 5 ' 1 and it was too short . ca n't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !"
__label__-1 "looked good in pictures . i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge ! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful it is very awkward and poor fit . will be sending back ."
__label__0 "the material and construction of the pants are great but the length is just plain awkward . i 'm 5 ' 4 and the regular came to just above my ankles and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way . a couple of inches longer and they would 've been fine or i could 've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants but the regular just did n't do it for me . also i 'm usually a size 6 ( 5 ' 4 125lbs ) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips ."

__label__-1 "dress appears to be slim fit but that 's far from the case . usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5 ' 3 but it just hung on me like a heavy sack . i have a hard time finding dresses now that i 'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions -- weddings memorials special occasions . i hoped this one would meet my needs . disappointed ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this vest in xxs since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest . even then the vest looked like a large . not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too . it just looked too big not artfully drapey ."
__label__0 "very cute dress just way too big . i ordered it online wish i would have gone a size smaller ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package . the fabric is extremely stiff and thin . the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through . the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children 's clothing . i also ordered the matching pj pants but did n't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater"
__label__1 "ever since i saw this dress i fall for it totally love the pattern and the colors . i got the size l and the fabric is really good . once i tried it on tho it broke my heart the dress fit perfect everywhere but in the v neck ... the design there is odd i believe is for small breast cup girls im size c and let me tell you it look horrible i was very disappointed so dress its going back : ("
__label__0 "bought this shirt in mid-july washed twice ( cold delicate ) and hung to dry . already holes/falling apart"
__label__0 "i loved this jumpsuit . it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame . i did prefer a belt which emphasized my shape . unfortunately it is not lined and a bit sheer . this was a deal breaker for me ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer but it just did n't work for me . it made me feel a bit frumpy honestly . i purchased the neutral color . maybe the red would have been less ... grandmotherly . something about the elastic waist just did n't work for me either . i tried this with boots booties heels clogs flats sandals and i just could n't make this dress work . sadly sending this one back . i 'm 5 ' 7 140 lbs and tried the medium ."
__label__0 "it made me look extra thick in the middle -- could pass for maternity wear . pretty colors . fabric is fine . it 's just too shapeless and not flattering on me . i 'm 5'11 and it was also on the short side for me . even if it fit better probably too short for my age ( 40s ) ."
__label__0 "the print is unique and fun . however the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet ."
__label__-1 "i waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away . i am disappointed ! ! ! the lace fabric is very stiff . i should have listened to the previous reviewer . i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck . although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress had the fabric been different i think it would be a great dress ."
__label__1 "i love the fabric since it 's fall was n't expecting it to be light . but its not heavy either . just the right balance . this is one of those classics . i love the collage like pattern of the fabric . the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots . ( dressed up or down ) ."
__label__1 "if i had n't seen the description online i would never have known these pants were navy ! i bought them today and tried them on with a black tunic which looked fantastic . the style is very similar to cartonnier slim pant but the fabric is lighter weight and stretchier . since i 'm heavy around the stomach i will wear the pant with a long tunic top ( to avoid the drumstick look ) which is a shame since the pockets are so cute . the colors in the pants mean that you can match and contrast with a wid"

__label__-1 "although i love retailer this product is n't the quality or presentation i expect from them . the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess . the fabric was n't soft and fluid as i expected but rather was stiff and a little scratchy . i purchased the ecru version which was also slightly darker than the photo showed . i returned the dress and will keep looking ."
__label__-1 "i love the design of this top however it 's quality is lackluster . the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering ( at least on me ) if it had a few more inches . also it 's pretty sheer so figuring out under garments is a dilemma . i will still wear it because i love it . looks great with a denim vest over it !"
__label__1 "another cloth and stone success ! love the back ! denim goes with most anything !"

__label__0 "really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece . unfortunately because i have ample hips the skirt just made me look very wide overall . in addition i am short at 5 ' 2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to like this top as the fabric was nice and thick but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape but i 've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy ( and i 'm not heavy ) . not great enough to keep in my opinion ."
__label__0 "loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low . unless you have 30 arms all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra"
__label__1 "it 's a pretty dress my only concern is the sleeve length . it 's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy . i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better ! . or if you are a savvy sewer you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted . overall quality and feel is very good . i usually fit into a 6 but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you do n't order the correct size ."
__label__0 "perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them ."
__label__1 "these pants are so soft and so comfortable ! i was absolutely in love at first sight . however i got the petite because i am 5 ' 3 and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be . i wanted them to hit right above the ankle just like the photo however they are a tad longer . i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever so i am gon na deal with the length ! !"
__label__0 "i am about 5 ' 6 135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium . i ordered a small as another reviewer did . right when i took it out of the packaging i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo . i knew the sweater was going to be cropped but it falls right at the top of my hip bones . when i raise my arms up my whole midriff shows . did not flatter my athletic build at all . the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine skimming but not tight"
__label__0 "pros : pretty nicely made . cons : the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting and the blouse cuts in under the arms . ( i do n't mean that it is tight or digs in but it cuts in ; you ca n't tell in the angle of the photo . ) the blouse is short as well and as i am curvy it really stuck out all around at the waist . worth trying on if you have a straighter figure ."
__label__-1 "this sweater is very long could be worn as a dress at 5 ' 3 !"
__label__1 "this is a classic ! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60 's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style ! ! ! love it !"
__label__1 "this is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small . i usually take a small but i took a medium in this . for reference i am 130 lbs chest 36c . i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate . got the 20 % off today and could n't be happier with this purchase ."
__label__-1 "i could n't wait to try this on this sweater . sadly it was too large in all ways . the sleeves are adorable but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms . this was much longer on me than the model . it stopped mid-thigh . the quality seemed fine but it is a thin sweater ."
__label__-1 "love the design of the fabric . i actually bought these in both colors . i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric it 's very scratchy ."
__label__1 "this is such a nice little sweater to add to a dress or tank . fits true to size and i love the tie and hook and eye closure . quality ."
__label__-1 "i did not like this cashmere sweater at all . i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color . although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40 % off ."
__label__0 "this dress is most definitely not a maxi ! barely goes below the knees . also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice . there are no folds which were an added plus on picture . waist is higher not at natural waist . very pretty silk though and still cute . just not as pictured ."
__label__1 "this dress is exactly what i was looking for . i have a very business casual job but wearing jeans and blouses can get boring so i 'm constantly on the lookout for easy go-to dresses that i can throw on year round with flats booties sandals etc . this dress is exactly what i had in mind and i look forward to wearing it in the fall/spring with booties and in the winter with tights ."
__label__1 "i love this sweatshirt . it 's super chic and sexy ( and for those of us that need actual support it looks great with a strappy sports bra ) . that said selling this as one size fits all is misleading at best . i 'm 5 ' 2 ~160 ( a lot of it muscle but i enjoy chorizo ) a 34ddd and this fit me perfectly but i ca n't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12. just be real -- this is a smedium . one star removed for the one size fits all fallacy ."
__label__0 "i should have exchanged it for a smaller size but i wanted to wear it so my mistake . i tend to wear size 12-14 and the large is entirely too big . it also had piling right out of the bag . but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway . if you get this size down for sure ."
__label__-1 "this top is gorgeous and beautifully made . however the fit leaves a lot to be desired . the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin . i tried to make this work but just could n't so it 's going back ."
__label__0 "i really like this shirt but it 's a bit maternity . i do n't mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here . i 'm 5 ' 7 about 125 and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret . since i 'm done having kids it has to go back . it 's also somewhat see through and had i kept it i would have worn a tank top underneath . as long as these things do n't bother you it really is cute !"
__label__-1 "this shirt is beautiful . it is flowy and light a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring . however do not follow the washing instructions on the tag . it says you can machine wash tumble dry low and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it . it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again . if you do order please take the"

__label__-1 "i have never written a review before and i love retailer and shop here often . however i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money . it is such poor quality it looks thick and flows in the photo it is very thin and it itches so bad i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail . i will deff be taking it back and do not recommend it at all ."
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this dress despite the reviews . when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric . the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious . the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric ( even though i absolutely loved the fabric ) . the flowing overlay was just too much . i am returning it ."
__label__1 "love this top ! not too low cut drapes nicely and the material is thin enough but not so thin you have to wear a tank top . it does seem to run on the larger side ."
__label__1 "nice top . armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i 'm picky about that . the print is pretty and unusual . it just did n't look great on me . there 's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely . it 's a lightweight tee fabric that 's opaque . i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible . great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down . i do recommend ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top . but it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic . re : hopeful but not good . the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on . sadly it is going back ."

__label__1 "this sweater looks just as pictured on the model . its very warm though even with cropped sleeves . i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy . i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems . outer grey material is n't very pleasant & itchy however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch ."
__label__-1 "purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail -- ( i do n't know why most designers overlook the back ? ? ) . huge disappointment -- the back is totally plain not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back is n't even the same material as the front . it 's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment . it was a very sad return ! i usually love this brand this was just a quality control oversight i guess ."
__label__0 "oh wow no . as the previous reviewer said much lighter than the picture ! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something . maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe ? the fit is true to size i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum ( waist 28/29 hips 36 usually a 27 or 28 in jeans sometimes even a 29 if they 're super skinny ) ."
__label__-1 "super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it ."

__label__0 "this piece is stunning . you can dress up or down with it . my husband said wow that 's very elegant . it is very soft . thin but warm . however it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric . i returned it for another . it is a very delicate fabric . the zig zag stitching may snag easily . i 'm afraid it will not wash well . definitely a hand wash item . i 'm not sure i will keep it in the end . the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item . quality"

__label__-1 "this is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer"
__label__1 "i bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i 'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge . i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i 'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly ... it 's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap . the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy . i 'm 5 ' 5 medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances . a medium would have probably worked normal"
__label__-1 "i read the existing reviews before purchasing and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large . this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer . i figured by ordering a medium i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater . this was not the case ! the sweater is short does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind ( and i assume the model is taller than i ... as models are usually tall ) . for reference i am 5 ' 6 '' medium build"

__label__1 "the fit on this dress is super flattering ! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one . i am definitely a pear shape bigger on the bottom than the top . one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top . this is not often the case . i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it . i also love the colors . i bought the green and blue . i have worn it once"

__label__1 "if you love the boho style then this too is for you . it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans leggings sandals boots and booties . i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall . it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 and bought the pm but needed the ps . i have recievied tons of compliments and i 'm thinking of getting the silver one too !"

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweatshirt but alas it is going back . upon opening and unfolding the first thing i noticed : the dots and not solid . they are sort of distressed looking with parts of them missing . secondly it does n't have a lot of structure . it 's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way . it 's just not flattering on me . it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house . for reference i ordered the 3 and i 'm usually a 10/12 in tops ."
__label__1 "i 'm a big fan of left of center as a brand and this top is definitely a winner ! the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim . the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tent-like . highly recommend !"
__label__1 "fits well comfortable and flattering . i would n't call this pattern fabric purple though . it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color .. the picture is an accurate representation of the color ."
__label__0 "i also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide . it was not flattering at all ."
__label__-1 "the back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird . the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy . i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front . it fits true to size ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this top ... and while it is soooo amazingly soft i still could not keep it . i must admit that i am only 5 ' 2 so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this ... but i felt like a matador which is definitely not what i was going for ... maybe if your tall and lean this would work . but for me no way ."
__label__1 "bought this skirt in the light plum color . nice soft corduroy fabric . it fit well . not too short . will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots . my only complaint . i wish it had pockets ."
__label__1 "i waited so long for a small petite to come back in stock and finally it did ... received the dress last week and it 's beautiful it was a perfect fit for me not to big not too small ( my size 5 ' 3/122lb ) . if you 're petite or very thin probably size down . i gave it 4 stars because of the quality ... some of the eyelets looked a little weathered . it is lined and there 's no see through . agree with other reviewers though - this dress is not worth $ 228 price tag ."
__label__-1 "i recently bought this dress and wore it once . i really liked it ! it was comfy cute and fit well . but ... then i washed it . i followed the washing instructions exactly but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it 's completely unwearable . i 'm super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer ."
__label__1 "i love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants . i get a lot of compliments on it . i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style . the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick . the color is true to what is shown . the fit is perfect and what i expected . i highly recommend the purchase ."
__label__-1 "sizing is just getting unreasonable and nothing fits unless it 's a crew neck nowadays . this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model but on my 5 ' 4 115 lb frame the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim . additionally the shirt looked like it shrunk in length and would n't have covered a belt on my pants . it also did not match the product description and measured 22 from the hps to hem . i 'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i"

__label__0 "i have to say being a silk lover decision was hard to make . the quality is phenomenal . i do agree to a reviewer that said it 's pj like . i tried it with belt did n't help much with the look somehow . it just felt empty . my daughter who i usually turn for opinions said ewww grandma ... i know truth hurts . i ca n't exchange for a smaller size either because the fabric is not stretchy and i 'm afraid the extra small would confine my arm movement . on top of that the background is more peachy tha"
__label__1 "i ordered top and pants online as seen . pants are of good quality and hang beautiful . i love the color and quality of the fabric . nice and vibrant . nice fit at the top into a flowy drape . the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size . love the outfit for my upcoming island trip ."
__label__1 "i really love this shirt for its versatility . it looks casual with jeans and dressy with a skirt or even jeans and heels . the shirt itself is super soft . it 's boxier than it looks in the picture but not to the point of crop-top . the shirt still hits at my hips ."
__label__0 "this dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible ! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl . now i know why there were so many in the store ! which is a rarity for my location ."
__label__0 "i read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online . for me they are a no . i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items ."

__label__-1 "i do n't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine . i also ordered the xs even though i 'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked . already returned it . on the plus side it 's gorgeous ."
__label__-1 "i fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online the slip underneath is a nude color . it fit well and i decided to keep it . i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it . i was driving with my son in the back seat i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress ( where the crocheting is ) ripped open ! ! i can not believe how poor the quality is at this price !"
__label__-1 "material is awful . not soft at all . colors are much darker than shows online . it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model . it went back ."
__label__1 "was hoping i was going to love this top and i did . its a fun piece to dress up or down ."
__label__-1 "i had such high hopes for this shirt ! i got it in both the black and moss ( which is a beautiful color ) . however the ruffle was just too big . i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown . it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves but on me it was not flattering at all ."
__label__1 "from the online pics i would never think to try this on but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets so glad i did ! i purchased in green and navy ... i love the neck line when buttoned up almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket . super soft material ... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5 ' 9 and 140 lbs ."
__label__0 "i want to love this shirt but it is n't happening . the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting . the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great if the fit works for you ."
__label__0 "i wanted to like this top as i usually adore a cute peplum feature . when i tried it on yesterday in the store i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it . i am petite ( 5 ' 2 110 lbs ) and i tried my usual xs . the fabric was substantial and of a high quality but unfortunately in this design that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me . it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt ! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing ."
__label__-1 "this sweater is a lovely color and very soft . however the sweater 'sheds ' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance . it 's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through ."
__label__0 "i like the feel stretch and softness of this dress it 's very comfortable . sadly as others have commented the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me . i considered sizing down to a 4 but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area . unfortunately it will have to go back . i am 5 ' 7 120 lbs 34d and ordered a 6 ."

__label__1 "i love the contemporary style of this piece but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me ( 5 ' 1 ) . but if you do n't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms it might work for you . the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces ."
__label__-1 "this dress runs so large why did they not make an extra small . the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering . i wish wish that they made this in the extra small i was swimming in it there was no way to fix it so it went back"

__label__-1 "i love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended . not so . for starters the top is much more of a beige in person . a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully . secondly there is just so . much . fabric . it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i 've tried to hard to make it work lastly the"

__label__1 "count me in as a five star lover of this dress ! the details are so rich and interesting so be prepared to get noticed when wearing . i 'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular ( instead of petite ) was a good choice for my top heavy frame . the chest is fitted but not tight the length is a not-too-short above knee the tiered layers swing so nicely and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design . my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie -- soo heavy cumbersome to style . o"
__label__0 "i followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down . however the jacket was still too large . it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge . also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy . it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes ."

__label__0 "this dress is a good casual summer dress . the material is thin and feels nice on . the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric does n't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam . the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose . however if you have a larger chest ( i 'm a 34c ) the hook and eye closure dones come undone . overall a good purchase . it looks good with a belt as well ."

__label__0 "this top was a disappointment for me . it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it 's shape . it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south .... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape ."
__label__0 "i love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears -- very detailed . it is both subtle ( not cheap looking ) and special . as an earlier reviewer noted the top is not see-through a plus . the drawbacks though mean that i will be returning this top . 1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well . i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose even in that size and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives"

__label__-1 "but it just does n't measure up . first the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head . and once on the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky . unfortunately i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately . the material is really cute but the dress is n't worth the price / effort ."
__label__0 "i do like the shape of this piece . it is eye catching due to the length and flattering . however if you are chesty this piece shows off more than i was comfy with and i do n't think i 've ever had that problem with retailer . in the body i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it . but up top the xs showed much too much cleavage .

__label__0 "let me start by saying that i can not wear wool . it does n't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere it makes me itch so much that i just ca n't do it and i did n't not find this as itchy as others stated . that being said you definitely need to size down . i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric . i still do n't know what to think . i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point ."
__label__-1 "i was expecting a lot more but this was disappointing . the material is thin and the quality is n't great . it also hung loose just too loose as it runs very very large i returned it"
__label__-1 "it is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable but the picture for this product is very deceiving ! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page but it is considerably short . i am nearly six foot tall but thought by this picture it would be lengthy not at all ! it is a beautiful sweater might work better for a shorter stature ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to like this dress . i am 5 ' 3 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long . the hem created a puddle around my feet . i 've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem . sadly it went back to the store ."
__label__1 "this dress will take you through fall winter and spring . i love all the stitching and design detail . it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back ."
__label__-1 "this top looks beautiful online . when i got it it looks nothing like the pic . it 's wide too much fabric no shape and so unflattering . it 's definitely going back"
__label__-1 "as a beach cover-up this would be great but i 'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and does n't show on the model how thin it is . it 's pretty sheer and i could n't get away without layering it ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 6 and it hits me at mid-thigh . the top ( black/camel version ) is sheer enough to need a cami . the waist is quite high . not flattering for me -- the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant -- plus i do n't want to deal with having to wear a cami ."
__label__-1 "the fabric and its texture did n't meet my expectations unfortunately . there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric ... however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears ."
__label__-1 "dress is much different in person . thin ribbed cotton . a little tight for xl . it looks like a throw back dress from contempos . returned and would not recommend"
__label__-1 "i was able to get this on sale . when it arrived it was missing half of the rhinestones . i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way . it also was missing the little bag with extra stones . i 'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse ? any help from anyone would be appreciated . i hate to part with this but where was quality control ?"
__label__-1 "this is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse which i also ordered . it 's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse . it added 20 pounds ! the print is beautiful . the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail . i ordered size large and am well endowed . steer clear if you have a bust ."
__label__-1 "i wished these fit a little better . unfortunately they were a little tight in the thighs and if i did n't pull the waist of the pants up i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out . needless to say i made a return ."
__label__1 "this is beautiful . it can serve as a sweater or a coat and i ca n't wait to start wearing it ."
__label__0 "i ordered my normal size and found that this top runs large . i wanted to tie the front ties tighter to accentuate my waist but even so it was still quite loose . the fabric is very stretchy and thin and the top was longer on me than pictured in the model . for reference i am 5'-7 155lbs usually wear a medium/8 in a top . this medium was too large ."
__label__-1 "sadly going back . ordered m light color option very difficult to pull over my head not a good sign . got it on and neckline looked attractive ( height w/o being a mock turtle ) but whole thing a bit small around middle . could order the l but i 'm not liking the feeling of the fabric it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch : 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex contrast which must mean the stripes . combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle"

__label__0 "it 's a beautiful sweater but it is very wide ( much wider than it looks on the model ) even in the xs/s . it is also fairly itchy . just way too big for my small frame which is not really the look i was going for ."
__label__-1 "ag jeans have been a main stay for me . they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body . however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked . the fabric and color is beautiful . i wear the same size for ag no matter the design . but this one ran too small . i have to return it . i will try the next size up if they still have them ."
__label__0 "i expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall -- the size small fit me fine -- i 'm about 140 and small in the chest but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could 've draped in a more attractive way . if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape it 'd be worth it but it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "the top is cute but when i received it it did not feel like cotton . the tag says 100 % viscose . i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future ! on the plus side the return was no problem ."
__label__0 "ca n't pants . the material is lightweight and perfect for summer . however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips . i am a solid size 30/8 and i could n't get the 30 over my hips ."
__label__-1 "i keep trying to find a peplum that works for me but so far i have been unsuccessful . i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together ? aside from the peplum issue this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large . the material alone is thick making it a bulkier shirt then add the volume of the peplum and i looked ( and felt ) huge . needless to say this one was returned sale or no sale ."
__label__1 "this top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it . the only complaint is that the front is very sheer . you have to wear an under shirt of some kind ."
__label__0 "i was disappointed that this dress had no pockets as every picture on this website suggests . otherwise it is a great color and shape . still sad though ..."
__label__-1 "this dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer 's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture which is how it looks from the photo . obviously it would have been more expensive but in any case this was just a really expensive polyester dress which it says in the product description but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product it 'll be retailer . but now i"

__label__1 "what i like about this is the yellow color peeking through the white it makes the tank look sunny/happy . soft tank fabric is really comfortable fit is loose and casual i was undecided but thought i have so many nice pieces i do n't need this one . xsp was a good fit . i am 115 lbs 30 dd ."

__label__-1 "it is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion . i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly ... this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women 's apparel sizing . i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small"
__label__-1 "i loved the colors ( especially the pink ) and thought this would be really pretty . however when i received it its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it . i also found it huge . normally i wear an xxsp or a 00p ( for reference i am 5 ' 2 30e and 24 in waist . i tried both the xxsp ( fit better but was too short ) and the xxs ( too large ) . i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted but its definitely not ."
__label__0 "this blazer is a nice weight for summer . it is more terracotta than rose but is still a nice color . the fit is tts and flattering . however the buttons were almost falling off the one i received . i did n't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it ."
__label__0 "i have mixed feelings on these . i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture . they are true to size cute and comfortable . i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes . plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas . i 'm not sure if this was a bad lot but back to the store they went ."
__label__-1 "this blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect . when i got it it looked like a big box and did n't fit anywhere . the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge . i got a small based on other reviews but it was way too big . sadly i had to return it ."
__label__0 "the material of the dress is gorgeous but the armholes droop much too low under the arms . in addition i am fairly broad shouldered and the cut across the chest is too narrow exposing your chicken wings in an unflattering way . this is gorgeous on the model so i would say narrow shouldered girls should order a size down and give it a shot !"
__label__-1 "i tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful . i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo i wore it one time and received so many compliments . when i washed it however it shrunk almost 1 size ! the pant legs were high water . i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it would n't budge i think because rayon is not stretchable material . to my disappointment i returned it . i really wished it would have worked out ."
__label__0 "i had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink . did not look at good as the beige ."
__label__-1 "i love finding unique retailer pieces that do n't require dry cleaning . i was excited to find this shirt but it 's not flattering . the bottom hem is a little tight which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky . perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips . i also did n't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person . i 'll be returning this item ."
__label__0 "i tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different awkward hem line . they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked . finally found one that was n't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs . i am a curvy athletic build with broad shoulders and small waist for your reference ."

__label__-1 "this dress is just very unattractive . it is quite short-waisted almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place . also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide . the effect is matronly not cute at all . size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good ."
__label__1 "this tank is well made and the top part is doubled ( partially ) so you can get away without wearing a bra ( if you wish ) . i 'm 5 ' 1 and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available . it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured . the pin-tucked area fit well not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i do n't mind . i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me . i opted for the white vs. the black because i love the pi"

__label__-1 "i had such high hopes for this blouse as it looks totally stunning online . however it 's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat but rather hd in paris . for the price the quality is just not there ... i 've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less . i returned it without a second thought ."
__label__-1 "super soft fabric however very short in the stride . i ordered an xl normally wear 12/14 . i had to return it ."
__label__-1 "good reason to read reviews . i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy . heavy fabric makes matters worse ."

__label__-1 "i saw this dress online and i thought it was perfectly cute ! however once i tried it on at home it just did n't work . one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning and once i got it on the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm . ( i 'm 5 ' 7 '' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2 ) . i did n't even try buttoning all the way . i took it back and i do n't even think i want a larger size . the buttons are just too fragile ."
__label__-1 "looked really cute on the hanger so i took it with me into the dressing room . the fabric is super soft and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short ! you ca n't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg . the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you 'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer . i wish i could pull this off ... maybe i 'm just too old for it ."
__label__1 "this poncho is lovely . i found it fits perfectly . im 5 ' 4 125 and got the xs/s .. just long enough ( loke jacket length ) and the hood doesnt add extra weight ( doesnt drag it down the back ) . arm holes are approriate size . very cool piece for any weather layering ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered but just decided to return . it runs big and from the front it looks good but the back just looked like a big oversized stretched out tank . it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing . so if you 're tall go for it ! !"
__label__0 "i ordered this top in 2 colors because i thought it would be great with leggings . i always love my retailer purchases but this fell a little short . i think it may be the type fabric it is but the way the back hangs so low on my frame ( 5 ' 4 ) it does n't drape nicely over my leggings . the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans it would be ok. i returned them both to the store . this is one that would be better to try on first ..."

__label__1 "really like the quality color and overall design of these jeans . they ran a little long on me but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties . i did n't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed . so glad that was the case given the price tag on them . i am 5 ' 7 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed . definitely recommend these jeans"
__label__1 "this is my first ever jumpsuit purchase and i love it ! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try and it fit perfectly ( i 'm 5 ' 7 120lbs slim ) . looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles ( still a couple inches above ) . the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of . the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun . would defi"
__label__-1 "ugh i hate that this did n't work ! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is ( the sides go way up on me ) . the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes !"
__label__0 "i look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size . for some reason this fabric is n't working for me . i think it 's the sheed combined with the stretch ( or lack there of ) of the fabric . i 'll have to pass ."

__label__-1 "the design of this sweater is odd . it made me feel very round when i put it on . the sleeves were wide . the other reviewers were correct in saying that it 's a thick sweater which i thought i 'd like . the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected . it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater ."
__label__-1 "this has such awful proportions . i 'm 5 ' 0 and 100 lbs ordered xxs petite ( in the neutral color ) . the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust ! ! it looks very unflattering and it 's very pronounced . i 'm only 5 ' 0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me . below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it 's sewed and it balloons outward and is very square from there down . very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi"
__label__0 "the print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch . unfortunately it runs quite small in the bust so i had to return it . for someone that is small busted it will be quite cute . everywhere else it is true to size ."

__label__0 "i 'm a consistent size 6 ( ordered a small ) with a pretty athletic build ( wide shoulders and strong arms ) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions . the sleeves and back were far too tight . additionally the bow did not cover my bra strap likely because it is n't made for someone my height . had to return ."
__label__-1 "this runs sooo big ! i normally wear a large ( 145lb 5'-4 36dd ) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large . the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together ! i loved the pattern color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent lol . also the back is slightly longer than the front something i couldnt see from the pictures online ."
__label__1 "great quality coat ! very pretty colors and love the sleeves ! i would have given 5 stars but like other reviewers stated this coat does she 'd . best not to wear black . it is a slight swing style coat so it 's not fitted at the waist and hips but very stylish . i found it best to size down . i 'm 5 ' 4 118lb but i 'm large chested ( 32dd ) i usually wear a size 6 coat or blazer so it fits my chest but the six was too big . the size 4 fit great across my chest and still room for a sweater !"

__label__-1 "i was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater . the sweater looks like it 's falling apart and it is huge . i would not recommend this even at a clearance price ."
__label__-1 "i purchased this in the yellow xs . it is very comfortable but extremely see-through . you 'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it but i 'm not sure what would work based on the style and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through . unfortunately i had to return it ."
__label__-1 "got this in the sky color . returned it because the top is way too sheer for me if you know what i mean . i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids . no can do . also for the price material just felt flimsy & cheap . it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i 'm 5 ' 2 114 # 34b"
__label__-1 "the fit of this top is nothing like in the photo . the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette . in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large . the embroidery details and soft material are great but the fit is off entirely . this item is going back ."
__label__-1 "i was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired . it fits tts length is fine ... the inside is some but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap ( kinda canvas feeling ? ) . the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way . it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm . this is definitely going back ."

__label__-1 "after reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale . i 'm tall and lean but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures . firstly the top has a strange transition to the skirt with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together . if you blouse it and lay flat it invariably gets bunched as you wear it . this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks creating less clean lines . i also found the blue black"

__label__-1 "this dress had so much potential . the top was absolutely gorgeous . my issue was with the bottom half of the dress . the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all . the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger . i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead ."
__label__-1 "there were just too many pleats to this thing . it was not flattering . it looks fantastic on this model but not on me . oh well ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail but the proportions are all off ! even the petite size is too long in the torso and the regular is laughable for anyone that is n't an amazon princess . and i 'm not even that short ( 5 ' 4 ) ! curvy ladies also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips . i would"
__label__1 "this is now one of my favorite retailer button downs . it 's super soft and super flattering . it 's everything you 'd want this cute shirt to be !"
__label__1 "this romper is fabulous ! i bought it in lime and the color is great and perfect for summer . i do agree with the other reviewers that it 's hard to get in and out of the sleeves ( hence giving it only 4 starts for quality # but the struggle is worth it . the fabric is lightweight and silky so it feels cool and soft ; it feels like wearing pjs . it 's also very flattering with the bow just at the waist ; it hides a not-so-flat tummy . i 'm 5 ' 4 between 135 and 140 and curvy # very busty specifically ) a"
__label__0 "this top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo and i am short at 5 ' 2. cute top but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top . it was huge and i did n't like the material . it felt like it should have been much less expensive than it was ."
__label__1 "fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off . the fabric is not stretchy . the lining is a nice navy . however the sleeves are not lined . the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it . it hit me at my waist . i 'm 5 ' 3 118 # . i loved this top . worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow . this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace ."
__label__-1 "this looked so odd on me ! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too . the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom . the top is really large as to be unflattering . perhaps it 's just that it does n't work on someone who is petite but this one is a return ."
__label__0 "i loved the look of this tunic . it is made well and very pretty . it was so big and heavy i had to return it . i think the small in this would be too big ."
__label__0 "this sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous ! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy . i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl ! this runs very small ."
__label__-1 "this jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on . i had to return it because of the poor design . it was extremely hard to put on and take off ! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps ! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons . what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material but not worth it if it 's difficu"
__label__1 "absolutely love this in blue . the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape . the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich . the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy . very happy with this purchase !"
__label__0 "a nice comfy sweatshirt . i do wish it was just a tad longer ; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i 'm only 5 ' 3 ! ( i purchased the regular size not the petite ) also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside ."
__label__0 "i was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it 's basically see-through . it 's well constructed it 's just a really thin material ."
__label__-1 "... for the model to look like this ? pros : nice quality . the colors of the blue version at least are rich and beautiful . note that the dark color pictured is really brown not black . the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture . it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter . it is layered over a bright navy poly slip . cons : i am 5 ' 8 135 # . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med . the sleeves were more dolman than fitted . i imagin"
__label__1 "beautiful washes well in a garment bag on delicate . has little clips in the shoulders to hold bra straps which is crucial with the scoop back if you have sloped shoulders like mine . i normally go for a large but was definitely a medium in this dress . 32 waist 32f bra only minor complaint is that the pattern ( at least on the red though probably also on the others ) is just printed on the outside and the inside is faded almost white so since the sides of the dress are slightly longer than"
__label__1 "love this suit . i ordered up a size on the bottoms and am so glad i did . the style fits true to size is beautiful and vibrant . i thought it looked like ribbing vertically but it is just part of the design . it is not padded at all but is thick enough to be seamless ."
__label__1 "beautiful shirt . the color is more navy than pictured . the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture . my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem ."
__label__0 "beautiful . got several compliments when wearing it . does not hold up with washes though . threads unraveling everywhere . i am thinking of returning it for this reason . fits true to size . i am 5 ' 4 118 lbs xs fit . i am smaller on top ."
__label__0 "i knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant ... i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks . it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works"
__label__-1 "it 's sheer the design /print is casual but on silk like material . had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it ! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer ? ? ?"
__label__0 "i saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out . it is quite a stunning piece . i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have . unfortunately there is entirely too much material in the bodice . it was overwhelming on me . for reference i am 5 3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin . i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress ."
__label__0 "i had such high hopes for this top . it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable ! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy . the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off . the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me ."
__label__0 "nice weight and loved the design but the inside was what i loved the most . it does n't show in the photos but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background . cute detail ! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves . they were about 2 too long ... and i have long arms ! there was n't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up . the only other option i came up with was to fold"
__label__0 "i think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured . i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed . the color is slightly brighter than the picture which is fine though i was digging the slightly greyed look . anyway these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else . i have a fairly athletic build so it 's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs"
__label__0 "i loved these pants.they are so comfortable . however after just wearing them twice the threads of the leaves are fraying and leaving lint on whatever i sit on . the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing . this after wearing twice to work ! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone or at least much less white with threads then the rest of the places . this is super unfortunate and will be returning . too bad they were l"
